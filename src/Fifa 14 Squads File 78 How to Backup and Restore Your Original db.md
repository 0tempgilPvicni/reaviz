FIFA, the international governing body of football, announced the chosen base camps for each team on 31 January 2014,[31] after providing them with a brochure of 84 potential locations across Brazil.[34] Most teams favored the Southeast Region of Brazil, which is the most populous and developed area of the country, with only eight teams opting for other regions; five teams (Croatia, Germany, Ghana, Greece and Switzerland) decided to stay in the Northeast Region, which is known for its beaches and cultural diversity, and three teams (Ecuador, South Korea and Spain) chose to stay in the South Region, which has a subtropical climate and a strong European influence. No team selected a base camp in the North Region or the Central-West Region, which are more remote and less urbanized.[35] Campo Bahia, the base camp of Germany, the team that won the tournament, attracted much attention for its luxurious and isolated facilities.[36]
  
The selection of base camps was an important strategic decision for the teams, as it could affect their performance and morale during the tournament. The teams had to consider factors such as climate, altitude, distance from the venues, security, infrastructure and local support. Some teams preferred to stay close to the coast, where the weather is warmer and more humid, while others opted for higher altitudes, where the air is cooler and thinner. Some teams chose to stay in large cities, where they could enjoy more amenities and entertainment options, while others preferred smaller towns, where they could have more privacy and tranquility. Some teams also tried to establish a connection with the local community, by visiting schools, hospitals and cultural sites, or by wearing shirts with messages of gratitude or solidarity.[37]

The base camps also reflected the different styles and philosophies of the teams and their coaches. Some teams opted for lavish and comfortable accommodations, while others chose more modest and functional ones. Some teams invested in state-of-the-art facilities and equipment, while others relied on more traditional methods and routines. Some teams allowed their players to have more freedom and flexibility, while others imposed more strict rules and schedules. Some teams also invited celebrities, journalists or fans to visit their base camps, while others kept them away from any distractions or pressures.[38]

The choice of base camps also had some controversies and challenges. Some teams faced criticism or protests from local residents or activists, who questioned the social and environmental impact of their presence or demanded better living conditions for themselves. Some teams also encountered difficulties or delays in finding or securing their desired locations, due to bureaucratic hurdles, contractual disputes or logistical problems. Some teams also had to deal with injuries, illnesses or infections among their players or staff, which affected their preparation and performance. Some teams also had to change their base camps during the tournament, either because they advanced to the knockout stage or because they wanted to avoid long travels or unfavorable conditions.[39]
