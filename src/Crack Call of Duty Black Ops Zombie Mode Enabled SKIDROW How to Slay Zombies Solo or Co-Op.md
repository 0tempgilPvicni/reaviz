You will need to download the cracked exe file from a reliable source and replace the original one in your game folder. Then, you will be able to enjoy the Zombie Mode with exclusive weaponry and equipment, and experience covert warfare and explosive conflicts across the globe.
 
## Step 1: Download the cracked exe file
 
The first step is to download the cracked exe file that will enable the Zombie Mode in your game. You can find it on various websites that offer game fixes and cracks, such as MegaGames[^1^] or Gamer.LK[^2^]. Make sure you download the file from a trusted source and scan it for viruses before opening it.
 
The file name should be something like Call.of.Duty.Black.Ops.Zombies.Solo.Mode.Enabler-SKIDROW.rar or Skid.zombie.CloudShadow.rar. It should be around 10 MB in size. Once you have downloaded it, extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
 
## Step 2: Replace the original exe file
 
The next step is to replace the original exe file in your game folder with the cracked one. To do this, you need to locate your game folder, which is usually in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops. If you have installed the game in a different location, you can find it by right-clicking on the game icon on your desktop or in your Steam library and choosing Properties > Local Files > Browse.
 
Once you have found your game folder, look for a file named BlackOps.exe. This is the original exe file that runs the game. You need to make a backup copy of this file in case something goes wrong or you want to restore the original game later. To do this, simply copy and paste the file to another location, such as your desktop or a USB drive.
