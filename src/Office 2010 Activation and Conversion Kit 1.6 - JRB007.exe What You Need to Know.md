The file has a description of "Activation Tool" and a version of 1.6.1.0. It has a size of 2547114 bytes and a MD5 hash of c07c80efd4a65b4ef8a9ce01a7183c36[^1^]. Some antivirus programs may detect it as a threat, such as HackTool:Win32/Keygen or Trojan[^2^], but some users claim that it is safe and effective[^1^]. However, using this tool may violate Microsoft's terms of service and expose your computer to security risks.
 
To use this tool, you need to download it from a reliable source and run it as an administrator. You will see a window with several options, such as "Activate Office 2010", "Convert Retail to VL", "Check Activation Status", etc. You can choose the option that suits your needs and follow the instructions on the screen. The tool will modify some registry entries and files in your Office installation folder to bypass the activation process.
 
However, before using this tool, you should be aware of the potential consequences. First of all, you may be breaking the law by using pirated software, which can result in legal actions or fines. Secondly, you may be compromising your computer's security by running an untrusted executable file that may contain malware or viruses. Thirdly, you may be damaging your Office installation by altering its files and settings, which may cause errors or crashes. Finally, you may be losing access to updates and support from Microsoft, which may affect your productivity and performance.
 
Therefore, it is recommended that you use a legitimate and licensed version of Office 2010 instead of using this tool. You can purchase a license key from Microsoft or an authorized reseller, or you can use an alternative office suite that is free and open source, such as LibreOffice or OpenOffice.
